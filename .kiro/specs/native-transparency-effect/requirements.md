# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a subtle native Apple transparency effect behind the note cards in the main window's notes list area. The transparency effect should integrate seamlessly with the existing theme system (light, dark, and dim themes) while providing the characteristic translucent backdrop blur that Apple applications typically feature. The effect should only be applied to the notes list background area in the main window, not affecting other parts of the application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the notes list background to have a native Apple transparency effect, so that the interface feels more polished and consistent with macOS design patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the main window is displayed THEN the notes list background SHALL have a subtle transparency effect with backdrop blur
2. WHEN the transparency effect is applied THEN it SHALL only affect the area behind the note cards in the notes list
3. WHEN the transparency effect is active THEN the underlying desktop or window content SHALL be visible through the blurred background
4. WHEN the user interacts with note cards THEN the transparency effect SHALL not interfere with readability or functionality

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the transparency effect to work with all existing themes, so that I can maintain my preferred visual appearance while enjoying the enhanced interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the light theme is active THEN the transparency effect SHALL blend appropriately with light theme colors
2. WHEN the dark theme is active THEN the transparency effect SHALL blend appropriately with dark theme colors  
3. WHEN the dim theme is active THEN the transparency effect SHALL blend appropriately with dim theme colors
4. WHEN switching between themes THEN the transparency effect SHALL adapt seamlessly to the new theme colors
5. WHEN themes are applied THEN the transparency effect SHALL maintain consistent visual hierarchy and contrast

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the transparency effect to be implemented using native platform capabilities, so that it performs well and looks authentic across different operating systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the transparency effect is implemented THEN it SHALL use Electron's native transparency and blur capabilities where available
2. WHEN the effect is active THEN it SHALL provide smooth performance without impacting application responsiveness
3. WHEN the application runs on macOS THEN the transparency effect SHALL match native macOS visual standards using vibrancy effects
4. WHEN the application runs on Windows THEN the transparency effect SHALL use Windows acrylic or backdrop blur effects where supported
5. IF native transparency effects are not available on a platform THEN the system SHALL provide a CSS-based fallback that mimics the visual appearance
6. WHEN platform-specific transparency is applied THEN it SHALL maintain consistent visual appearance across all supported platforms

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the transparency effect to be scoped only to the notes list area, so that other interface elements remain unaffected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the transparency effect is applied THEN it SHALL only affect the background area behind the notes list
2. WHEN the transparency effect is active THEN the sidebar, header, and other UI elements SHALL remain unchanged
3. WHEN note cards are displayed THEN they SHALL maintain their current appearance and opacity
4. WHEN the notes list is empty THEN the transparency effect SHALL still be visible in the empty state
