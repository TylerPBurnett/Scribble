# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on implementing high-impact React performance optimizations to reduce unnecessary re-renders, improve component efficiency, and enhance overall application responsiveness. The optimizations target key components like NoteEditor (which has 13+ useState hooks), NoteCard (which has 8+ useState hooks and complex menu logic), and NoteList (which performs expensive sorting operations on every render) that are frequently rendered and currently causing performance bottlenecks.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the note interface to respond quickly when I interact with notes, so that I can work efficiently without lag or delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user scrolls through the note list THEN the application SHALL render only visible components without re-rendering unchanged note cards
2. WHEN a user types in the note editor THEN the system SHALL update only the editor component without triggering re-renders of the note list
3. WHEN a user filters or sorts notes THEN the system SHALL complete the operation in under 100ms for collections with up to 1000 notes
4. WHEN a user switches between notes THEN the system SHALL display the new note content within 50ms

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want components to use React optimization patterns, so that the application maintains good performance as it scales.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN NoteCard components are rendered THEN the system SHALL wrap them with React.memo to skip re-rendering when note data hasn't changed
2. WHEN NoteList performs sorting operations THEN the system SHALL use useMemo to cache the results of expensive sortNotes computations and avoid re-sorting on every render
3. WHEN NoteEditor manages state THEN the system SHALL consolidate the 13+ individual useState hooks into fewer, more efficient state management patterns (useReducer or combined state objects)
4. WHEN event handlers are defined in frequently re-rendered components THEN the system SHALL wrap them with useCallback to prevent child components from re-rendering due to new function references

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the note editor to remain responsive during heavy typing sessions, so that my writing flow isn't interrupted by performance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types continuously in the editor THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent keystroke response times under 16ms
2. WHEN the editor has complex formatting or long content THEN the system SHALL not block the UI thread during updates
3. WHEN multiple editor features are active simultaneously THEN the system SHALL prioritize text input responsiveness over other operations
4. IF the editor state becomes complex THEN the system SHALL use optimized state management patterns to prevent cascading re-renders

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want note list operations like filtering and sorting to be instantaneous, so that I can quickly find and organize my notes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user applies filters to the note list THEN the system SHALL display results immediately without visible delay
2. WHEN a user changes sort criteria THEN the system SHALL reorder notes within 50ms
3. WHEN the note list contains many items THEN the system SHALL use memoization to avoid recalculating unchanged filter results
4. IF filter or sort operations are expensive THEN the system SHALL cache results until underlying data changes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to measure and monitor component performance, so that I can identify and address performance regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components are optimized THEN the system SHALL provide measurable improvements in render times
2. WHEN performance optimizations are implemented THEN the system SHALL maintain existing functionality without breaking changes
3. WHEN components use optimization patterns THEN the system SHALL follow React best practices and patterns
4. IF performance regressions occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear indicators of which components are causing issues
