# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on significantly improving the WYSIWYG markdown note editing experience by enhancing the Tiptap editor functionality and redesigning the toolbar interface. Similar to Obsidian, the editor should provide a seamless markdown editing experience where users can write in markdown syntax while seeing formatted output in real-time. The goal is to create an intuitive, markdown-native editing environment that makes writing and formatting notes effortless for markdown users.

2. WHEN the user indents lists with spaces/tabs THEN the system SHALL provide visual nesting with proper markdown syntax preservation
3. WHEN the user creates nested lists THEN the system SHALL automatically handle proper markdown indentation and visual hierarchy
4. WHEN the user types task list syntax (- [ ], - [x]) THEN the system SHALL render interactive checkboxes that update the underlying markdown
