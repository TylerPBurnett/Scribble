# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Investigate and identify the exact root cause of hotkey save failure
  - Add comprehensive logging to SettingsDialog.tsx onSubmit function to track hotkey data flow
  - Add logging to SettingsService.ts saveSettings function to verify hotkey persistence
  - Create a test script to reproduce the bug and verify the exact failure point
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [x] 2. Fix the core hotkey save issue in SettingsDialog component
  - Modify the onSubmit function in SettingsDialog.tsx to ensure hotkeys are properly included in the settings object
  - Add explicit validation that the hotkeys property exists and contains the expected data before saving
  - Fix any issues with hotkey state merging with form values
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_

- [ ] 3. Enhance SettingsService to properly handle hotkey persistence
  - Add explicit logging in saveSettings function to track hotkey data being saved
  - Add validation in saveSettings to ensure hotkeys property is present and valid
  - Add verification after localStorage.setItem to confirm hotkeys were actually written
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.3, 4.2, 4.5_

- [ ] 4. Add comprehensive error handling and user feedback
  - Add try-catch blocks around hotkey save operations with specific error messages
  - Add user-visible success/error notifications for hotkey save operations
  - Add fallback handling if hotkey save fails to prevent data loss
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 4.4_

- [ ] 5. Add verification and testing for hotkey save process
  - Create verification function that reads back from localStorage after saving to confirm persistence
  - Add automated test to verify hotkey changes are properly saved and retrieved
  - Add manual test script to verify the specific bug scenario is fixed
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 2.4, 4.5_

- [x] 6. Ensure immediate hotkey activation after save
  - Verify that main process sync properly receives and applies hotkey changes
  - Add notification mechanism to update note windows with new hotkeys immediately
  - Test that new hotkeys work without requiring app restart
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [ ] 7. Add comprehensive logging and debugging support
  - Add detailed logging throughout the hotkey save process for future debugging
  - Add logging to track hotkey state changes in HotkeysSection and HotkeyEditor components
  - Add performance logging to identify any bottlenecks in the save process
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5_

- [ ] 8. Create comprehensive test suite for hotkey functionality
  - Write unit tests for SettingsDialog hotkey state management
  - Write integration tests for complete hotkey save flow
  - Write tests for error scenarios and edge cases
  - Create manual test procedures for QA verification
  - _Requirements: All requirements validation_
