# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will integrate and enhance the existing collections functionality in the Scribble note-taking app. Collections allow users to organize their notes into categorized groups like "Shopping", "To Do", "Backlog", etc., providing a modern and intuitive way to manage notes beyond a simple list. The feature will include a sleek tab-based interface, drag-and-drop functionality, and seamless note organization capabilities.
