# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will transform the note-taking application into a highly customizable user interface system that follows Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui best practices. The goal is to provide users with extensive customization options for themes, layouts, spacing, typography, and visual elements while maintaining the current functionality and aesthetic appeal. This system will leverage modern design patterns and CSS custom properties to create a flexible, user-controlled interface that can adapt to individual preferences and use cases.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to customize the visual theme of my application, so that I can personalize the interface to match my preferences and work environment.

2. WHEN the user selects a color scheme THEN the system SHALL apply the changes immediately with live preview
3. WHEN the user adjusts primary, secondary, and accent colors THEN the system SHALL update all UI components consistently
4. WHEN the user switches between light and dark modes THEN the system SHALL maintain their custom color choices
5. IF the user creates a custom theme THEN the system SHALL save it for future use
6. WHEN the user exports a theme THEN the system SHALL generate a shareable theme file

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to adjust typography settings throughout the application, so that I can optimize readability and visual hierarchy for my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses typography settings THEN the system SHALL provide controls for font family, size, weight, and line height

3. WHEN the user adjusts font sizes THEN the system SHALL maintain proper scaling relationships between headings and body text
4. WHEN the user modifies line height THEN the system SHALL update spacing for optimal readability
5. IF the user selects a system font THEN the system SHALL fall back gracefully on different operating systems
6. WHEN the user resets typography THEN the system SHALL restore default shadcn/ui typography settings

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to customize spacing and layout density, so that I can optimize the interface for my screen size and workflow preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens layout settings THEN the system SHALL provide density controls (compact, comfortable, spacious)
2. WHEN the user selects compact density THEN the system SHALL reduce padding and margins while maintaining usability
3. WHEN the user chooses spacious density THEN the system SHALL increase whitespace for better visual breathing room
4. WHEN the user adjusts component spacing THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent spacing ratios
5. IF the user has a small screen THEN the system SHALL automatically suggest compact density
6. WHEN the user changes density THEN the system SHALL preserve all other customization settings

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to customize individual UI components, so that I can fine-tune the interface elements I interact with most frequently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user enters component customization mode THEN the system SHALL highlight customizable elements
2. WHEN the user clicks on a component THEN the system SHALL show relevant customization options
3. WHEN the user modifies button styles THEN the system SHALL update all buttons of that variant consistently
4. WHEN the user adjusts card appearances THEN the system SHALL apply changes to note cards and other card components
5. IF the user customizes input fields THEN the system SHALL maintain accessibility standards
6. WHEN the user resets a component THEN the system SHALL restore its default shadcn/ui styling

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to save and manage multiple customization presets, so that I can quickly switch between different interface configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user creates customizations THEN the system SHALL offer to save them as a preset
2. WHEN the user names a preset THEN the system SHALL store all current customization settings
3. WHEN the user switches presets THEN the system SHALL apply all settings instantly
4. WHEN the user shares a preset THEN the system SHALL generate an importable configuration file
5. IF the user imports a preset THEN the system SHALL validate compatibility and apply settings safely
6. WHEN the user deletes a preset THEN the system SHALL confirm the action and remove it permanently

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the customization system to follow Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui best practices, so that the interface remains consistent, performant, and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN customizations are applied THEN the system SHALL use CSS custom properties for dynamic theming
2. WHEN colors are changed THEN the system SHALL maintain proper contrast ratios for accessibility
3. WHEN components are customized THEN the system SHALL preserve shadcn/ui component structure and behavior
4. WHEN themes are generated THEN the system SHALL follow Tailwind CSS design token conventions
5. IF customizations conflict with accessibility standards THEN the system SHALL warn the user and suggest alternatives
6. WHEN the system updates THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing customizations
