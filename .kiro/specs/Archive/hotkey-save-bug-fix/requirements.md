# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses a critical bug in the main settings window where hotkey changes are not being saved to localStorage. When users modify keyboard shortcuts in the main app settings and click "Save", the changes appear to be accepted but are not actually persisted, making the hotkey customization feature completely non-functional.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want my hotkey changes to be properly saved when I modify them in the settings window, so that my custom keyboard shortcuts are actually applied and persist across app sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user changes a hotkey in the main settings window (e.g., "Toggle editor toolbar" from Alt+T to Cmd+3) THEN the system SHALL capture the change correctly
2. WHEN a user clicks "Save" in the settings dialog THEN the system SHALL persist the hotkey changes to localStorage without errors
3. WHEN hotkey changes are saved THEN the app_settings object in localStorage SHALL contain the updated hotkey values
4. WHEN the settings window is reopened after saving hotkey changes THEN the system SHALL display the previously saved custom hotkeys

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want immediate feedback when my hotkey changes are saved, so that I can verify the changes were applied successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN hotkey changes are successfully saved to localStorage THEN the system SHALL provide visual confirmation of the save operation
2. WHEN there is an error saving hotkey changes THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
3. WHEN hotkey changes are saved THEN the system SHALL log the save operation for debugging purposes
4. WHEN the save operation completes THEN the system SHALL verify that the changes were actually written to localStorage

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want my custom hotkeys to work immediately after saving them, so that I don't need to restart the application to use my new shortcuts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN hotkey changes are saved in the main settings window THEN note windows SHALL immediately recognize and use the new hotkeys
2. WHEN a user tests a newly saved hotkey in a note window THEN the system SHALL respond with the correct action
3. WHEN hotkey changes are applied THEN the system SHALL update all relevant components that use hotkeys
4. WHEN the main process receives hotkey updates THEN it SHALL properly register the new global hotkeys

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive logging and error handling for the hotkey save process, so that I can quickly diagnose and fix any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the hotkey save process begins THEN the system SHALL log the current and new hotkey values
2. WHEN localStorage operations occur THEN the system SHALL log success or failure with detailed information
3. WHEN the main process sync occurs THEN the system SHALL log the sync status and any errors
4. WHEN hotkey validation fails THEN the system SHALL log the validation error with context
5. WHEN the save process completes THEN the system SHALL verify and log the final state of localStorage
